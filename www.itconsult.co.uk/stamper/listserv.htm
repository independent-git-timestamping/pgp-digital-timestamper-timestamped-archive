<P>The list server operates by reading lines in the BODY of any received message and processes each line as a command.  It stops when it finds either a blank line or a line beginning with a dash ("-").  Multiple commands may be included within each message to the list server.</P>
<P>For each message (comprising one or more commands) it receives the list server will send a message in reply indicating each command it tried to execute and whether the command succeeded.</P>
