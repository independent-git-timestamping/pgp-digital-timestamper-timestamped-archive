<H1>PGP Digital Timestamping Service</H1>
<P Align="Center"><HR Size=2 Width=100%></P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Early in 1995 I was looking for an automatic digital timestamping service which could be used to corroborate the date at which I had signed a document with PGP.  At that point I could only find one commercial service and that used proprietary software.</P>
<P>I therefore resolved to setup such a service which would be free of charge to users.  I wanted to use PGP as the signing software and provide the service by Internet email, which was at the time by far the most common form of connection to the Internet.</P>
<P>Stamper was therefore launched in October 1995.</P>
<P>In April 1997, proof of posting certificates were added.</P>
<H2>Using the Service</H2>
<P>The service operates in a number of different "modes" depending upon the required results.  The current modes are:-</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI><I>post</I>: forwarding an outbound message with a proof of posting certificate</LI>
<LI><I>clear</I>: the received message is clearsigned and returned to the sender</LI>
<LI><I>header</I>: the received message (with headers) is clearsigned and returned to the sender</LI>
<LI><I>text</I>: the received message is signed and returned ASCII armoured to the sender</LI>
<LI><I>pgp</I>: the received message (which <strong>must</strong> be ASCII armoured) is assumed to be a PGP file which is then signed and returned to the sender</LI>
<LI><I>binary</I>: the received message (which <strong>must</strong> be ASCII armoured) is assumed <strong>not</strong> to be a PGP file which is then signed and returned to the sender</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<H3>Using the service in <I>post</I> mode</H3>
<P>This mode is used to forward a message providing a proof of posting certificate.</P>
<P>The message should be addressed to <A HREF="mailto:post@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">post@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A> and must contain one line in the <strong>body</strong> of the message for each recipient of the form:-</P>
<PRE>
     X-Stamper-To: emailaddress
</PRE>
<P>Multiple recipients must have <strong>separate</strong> X-Stamper-To: lines.  It is also important that the "X" must start in column 1.</P>
<P>The message signed with a proof of posting certificate and will be queued for sending to the addresses given.  It will be resent <em>in the name of the original sender</em> so any bounce messages will go back directly to the sender.  A copy of the posted message will also be returned to the sender.</P>
<P>It is important to note that such a certificate guarantees that someone claiming to be the sender asked Stamper to send the message to the listed recipients.  It does <strong>not</strong> guarantee that the message was delivered, and it does <strong>not</strong> authenticate the sender in any way.</P>
<P>Should you wish to send a pgp clearsigned message, the "X-Stamper-To:" directives should be inserted <strong>before</strong> the "-----BEGIN PGP" part of the message.  If it is put inside, Stamper will remove the line which will cause the signature validation to fail.</P>
<P>An <A HREF="post.htm">example of use</A> is also available.</P>
<H3>Using Stamper in <I>clear</I> mode</H3>
<P>This mode is used to get a clearsigned copy of the received message text.  The message should be sent to <A HREF="mailto:clear@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">clear@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A>.</P>
<H3>Using Stamper in <I>header</I> mode</H3>
<P>This mode is used to get a clearsigned copy of the received message text and message headers.  The message should be sent to <A HREF="mailto:header@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">header@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A>.</P>
<P>In this case it is important to be aware that the headers received by Stamper may have been forged.</P>
<H3>Using Stamper in <I>text</I> mode</H3>
<P>This mode is used to get a signed and ASCII armoured copy of the received message test.  The message should be sent to <A HREF="mailto:text@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">text@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A>.</P>
<H3>Using Stamper in <I>pgp</I> mode</H3>
<P>This mode is used to get an existing pgp file signed and the result returned to the sender.  Typically this would be used to get a "compound" signature on a document by sending Stamper a signed document or a detached signature certificate.</P>
<P>The ASCII armoured pgp file should be send to <A HREF="mailto:pgp@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">pgp@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A>.</P>
<P>For the technically minded this mode removes the ascii armour and signs the resulting document using:-</P>
<PRE>
     pgp -sba receivedmessage -o returnedmessage +batch +force
</PRE>
<H3>Using Stamper in <I>binary</I> mode</H3>
<P>This mode is used to get a binary file signed and the result returned to the sender.</P>
<P>The ASCII armoured binary file should be send to <A HREF="mailto:binary@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">binary@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A>.</P>
<P>For the technically minded this mode removes the ascii armour and signs the resulting document using:-</P>
<PRE>
     pgp -sba receivedmessage -o returnedmessage +batch
</PRE>
<P>The only difference between this and PGP mode, is that Stamper will assume that the underlying file has <strong>NOT</strong> been produced by PGP.</P>
<H2>Trusting Stamper</H2>
<P>It would be very easy for me to try and say what a reliable and trustworthy sort of a fellow I am and that you can naturally assume that Stamper will provide accurate timestamps which will never be backdated.  This would not be good enough!!</P>
<P>Every signature made by Stamper will have a unique serial number.  This number automatically increments by one every time a document is signed.  Stamper also stamps summaries of its own signatures from the previous day.</P>
<P>Each signature will be retained by Stamper and may be inspected by anyone.  The only details which will be disclosed will be the detached signature (not what is returned to the user), its serial number and the time &amp; date it was made.  Specifically any message text or email addresses will <strong>NOT</strong> be disclosed.</P>
<P>Thus the combination of the serial number being in chronological order coupled with publishing the signatures should provide sufficient certainty that timestamps have not been back (or forward) dated.</P>
<P>Stamper will generate two types of daily files: an updated log showing the last signature serial number made on each day (called <tt>SIGYYYY.TXT</tt>), and a zip file of all the detached signatures made on that day (called <tt>YYYYMMDD.ASC</tt>).  In these cases <tt>YYYY</tt>, <tt>MM</tt> &amp; <tt>DD</tt> represent the components of a date.  These <A HREF="http://stamper.itconsult.co.uk/stamper-files/index.htm">files are available via this website</A> or may be requested from the list server list@itconsult.co.uk by sending it a message containing the line <tt>"GET STAMPER-FILES filename</tt>" (without the quotes) in the <em>BODY</em> of the message.  Multiple files may be requested on separate lines in the body of the same message to<A HREF="mailto:list@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">list@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A>.</P>
<P>The daily zip files will have been signed by Stamper (complete with serial number, as normal) and will have ASCII armour.  Note that you will require zip file processing software in order to extract the individual signatures.  Other formats may be considered if there is sufficient demand.</P>
<P>In order to enhance the trustworthiness of the service, the detached signatures of the daily zip files will be published weekly in the Usenet group comp.security.pgp.announce for the week ending the previous Saturday.  They will also be sent by email to users who request this by sending a message to <A HREF="mailto:list@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">list@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A> with "<tt>JOIN STAMPER-ANNOUNCE</tt>" (without the quotes) in the <em>BODY</em> of the message.</P>
<P>These weekly messages will also be available from <tt>STAMPER-FILES</tt> named <tt>WKYYYYMMN.TXT</tt>, where <tt>YYYY</tt> &amp; <tt>MM</tt> are the year and month and <tt>N</tt> is the number of the Saturday in the month.</P>
<H2>Support</H2>
<P>If support is required, mail messages should be sent to <A HREF="mailto:support@stamper.itconsult.co.uk">support@stamper.itconsult.co.uk</A>.  It would be really appreciated if support queries were <em>not</em> sent to any other email addresses.</P>
<H2>Public Keys</H2>
<P>Following are the public keys relating to Stamper.  <em>Please note that the key for Stamper itself is 2046 bits which requires a recent version of PGP.</em></P>
<!-- PLEASE NOTE that, as this message is "clearsigned", it is either necessary to feed it through pgp to get an output file or remove the "- " on the front of the PGP key header & footer before adding the keys.-->
